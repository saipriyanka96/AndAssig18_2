         uri	Uri: The URI, using the content:// scheme, for the content to retrieve.
         This value must never be null.

         projection	String: A list of which columns to return. Passing null will return all columns, which is inefficient.
         selection	String: A filter declaring which rows to return, formatted as an SQL WHERE clause (excluding the WHERE itself). Passing null will return all rows for the given URI.
         selectionArgs	String: You may include ?s in selection, which will be replaced by the values from selectionArgs, in the order that they appear in the selection. The values will be bound as Strings.
         This value may be null.

         sortOrder	String: How to order the rows, formatted as an SQL ORDER BY clause (excluding the ORDER BY itself). Passing null will use the default sort order, which may be unordered.
         cancellationSignal	CancellationSignal: A signal to cancel the operation in progress, or null if none. If the operation is canceled, then OperationCanceledException will be thrown when the query is executed.
